# Windows Service vs Startup Application

## üéØ **Quick Answer:**

**WindowSupportGuardian does NOT need startup folder or scheduled task!**

It's a **Windows Service** which has its own automatic startup mechanism.

---

## üìä **The Two Components:**

### **1. WindowPowerShellProvider** (The Worker)

**Type:** Regular Application

**Auto-Start Methods:**
- ‚úÖ Scheduled Task (`WindowSupportMonitor`)
- ‚úÖ Startup Folder Shortcut (`WindowSupport.lnk`)

**How It Registers:**
```python
# In WindowPowerShellProvider.py
def add_to_startup():
    # Creates scheduled task
    schtasks /create /tn "WindowSupportMonitor" ...
    
    # Creates startup shortcut
    win32com.client.Dispatch("WScript.Shell").CreateShortCut(...)
```

**Starts:** After user logs in (user context)

---

### **2. WindowSupportGuardian** (The Guardian)

**Type:** Windows Service

**Auto-Start Method:**
- ‚úÖ Windows Service Manager (configured with `sc config`)

**How It Registers:**
```batch
# Via installer or manually
WindowSupportGuardian.exe install
sc config WindowSupportGuardian start= auto
sc start WindowSupportGuardian
```

**Starts:** At system boot, before user login (system context)

---

## üîß **How Windows Services Work:**

### **Installation:**
```batch
WindowSupportGuardian.exe install
```

This registers the service with Windows Service Control Manager (SCM).

### **Configuration:**
```batch
# Set to automatic startup
sc config WindowSupportGuardian start= auto

# Or manual startup
sc config WindowSupportGuardian start= demand

# Or disabled
sc config WindowSupportGuardian start= disabled
```

### **Control:**
```batch
# Start service
sc start WindowSupportGuardian

# Stop service
sc stop WindowSupportGuardian

# Check status
sc query WindowSupportGuardian
```

### **View in GUI:**
```
services.msc
```
Look for: "Window Support Guardian Service"

---

## ‚úÖ **What I Updated:**

### **In INSTALL_WindowSupport.bat:**

Added automatic startup configuration:

```batch
:: After installing service
sc config WindowSupportGuardian start= auto
```

This ensures the service starts automatically at system boot.

## üìã **Startup Comparison:**

| Feature | WindowPowerShellProvider | WindowSupportGuardian |
|---------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| **Type** | User Application | System Service |
| **Scheduled Task** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No (not needed) |
| **Startup Folder** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No (not needed) |
| **Service Manager** | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Starts When** | User logs in | System boots |
| **Runs As** | Current user | SYSTEM or specified account |
| **Needs User Login** | Yes | No |
| **Can Run Before Login** | No | Yes |

## üéØ **Why Guardian is a Service:**

### **Advantages:**

1. **Starts Earlier**
   - Boots with system, before user login
   - Can start Provider as soon as user logs in

2. **More Reliable**
   - Managed by Windows Service Manager
   - Auto-restart on failure (built-in)
   - Survives user logoff

3. **System-Level**
   - Can monitor all users
   - Higher privileges
   - Independent of user session

4. **Professional**
   - Standard Windows service
   - Manageable via `services.msc`
   - Can be controlled remotely

## üß™ **How to Verify Guardian Auto-Start:**

### **Check Service Configuration:**
```batch
sc qc WindowSupportGuardian
```

Look for:
```
START_TYPE: 2 AUTO_START
```

### **Check Current Status:**
```batch
sc query WindowSupportGuardian
```

Should show:
```
STATE: 4 RUNNING
```

### **Via GUI:**
1. Press `Win + R`
2. Type: `services.msc`
3. Find: "Window Support Guardian Service"
4. Check properties:
   - **Startup type:** Automatic
   - **Status:** Running

---

## üîÑ **What Happens at Startup:**

### **System Boot Sequence:**

```
1. Windows starts
2. Services start (including WindowSupportGuardian)
3. Guardian waits for user login
4. User logs in
5. Guardian detects user
6. Guardian checks if WindowPowerShellProvider is running
7. If not, Guardian starts it (via scheduled task or directly)
```

**Meanwhile, independently:**

```
1. User logs in
2. Scheduled task "WindowSupportMonitor" triggers
3. WindowPowerShellProvider starts from scheduled task
4. OR startup shortcut runs WindowPowerShellProvider
```

**Result:** Multiple layers of protection ensure Provider always starts!

---

## üìù **Summary:**

| Component | Startup Method | Location |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| **Provider** | Scheduled Task | Task Scheduler |
| **Provider** | Startup Shortcut | Startup Folder |
| **Guardian** | Windows Service | Services Manager |

**All three ensure the application starts automatically!**

---

## ‚úÖ **Current Configuration:**

After running the updated installer:

### **Provider (WindowPowerShellProvider):**
- ‚úÖ Scheduled task created
- ‚úÖ Startup shortcut created
- ‚úÖ Self-registers when run

### **Guardian (WindowSupportGuardian):**
- ‚úÖ Installed as Windows Service
- ‚úÖ Configured for automatic startup
- ‚úÖ Started immediately
- ‚ùå **Does NOT need** scheduled task or startup shortcut

---

## üéØ **Bottom Line:**

**WindowSupportGuardian is a Windows Service = It ALREADY has automatic startup built-in!**

No need for:
- ‚ùå Scheduled tasks
- ‚ùå Startup folder shortcuts
- ‚ùå Registry run keys

Just needs:
- ‚úÖ `sc config WindowSupportGuardian start= auto`

**Already done by the updated installer!** ‚ú®

## üîç **If You Want to Manually Configure:**

```batch
:: Install service
cd "C:\Users\avant\AppData\Local\WindowSupport\WindowSupportGuardian"
WindowSupportGuardian.exe install

:: Configure automatic startup
sc config WindowSupportGuardian start= auto

:: Start service
sc start WindowSupportGuardian

:: Verify
sc query WindowSupportGuardian
```

**That's it! No startup folder needed!** üëç
