 @WindowPowerShellProvider.py 
okay listen to me carefully, this is my production level project, and this @WindowPowerShellProvider.py is transformed into the exe, 
and deployed on more than 100 plus computers,

but Im having issues, major issues,
1) as it stoped eventually, and didnt run after that,
2) sometimes its stoped eventually, but starts running after the is computer ON after the shutdown
3) and sometimes its running showing in the task manager but not doing anything.

Actually it is deployed on the corporate offices on their employee machines, as it is added in the window startup so employee shift is 9 hours so the exe must running around 9 hours, yes it can be less and more according to the employee.

why it stoped please tell me. 
and the exe is without screen, onconsole, purely act like a background prcess
