WHY THE CHANGE?
===============

Your programs used to be SINGLE FILES (like a single document).
Now they are FOLDERS (like a folder with many documents inside).

Think of it like this:

BEFORE:
  📄 WindowPowerShellProvider.exe         (one file, crashes ❌)

AFTER:
  📁 WindowPowerShellProvider/            (a folder ✅)
     ├── 📄 WindowPowerShellProvider.exe  (the main program)
     └── 📁 _internal/                    (helper files it needs)
         ├── 📄 python311.dll
         ├── 📄 many other files
         └── ...

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE RELATIONSHIP:
=================

You have TWO programs:

1. 📱 WindowPowerShellProvider  ← The main worker
   - Sends screenshots
   - Tracks activity
   - Talks to the server

2. 🛡️ WindowSupportGuardian     ← The protector/monitor
   - Watches the main worker
   - Restarts it if it stops
   - Makes sure it keeps running

THE GUARDIAN NEEDS TO FIND THE WORKER!

Before:
  Guardian looks here: C:\Apps\WindowPowerShellProvider.exe  ❌ Not found!

After my fix:
  Guardian looks here: C:\Apps\WindowPowerShellProvider\WindowPowerShellProvider.exe  ✅ Found!

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT I FIXED:
=============

Think of it like giving someone directions to your house:

OLD DIRECTIONS (wrong):
  "Go to Main Street and knock on the door"  ❌
  Problem: There's no door directly on Main Street anymore!

NEW DIRECTIONS (correct):
  "Go to Main Street, enter the WindowPowerShellProvider building,
   then find the office inside"  ✅

I updated the Guardian's "directions" so it knows to look INSIDE
the WindowPowerShellProvider FOLDER, not just on Main Street.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

VISUAL DIAGRAM:
===============

Your Computer's Folders:
│
└── 📁 WindowSupport/                    ← The main folder
    │
    ├── 📁 WindowPowerShellProvider/     ← Worker's house
    │   ├── 📄 WindowPowerShellProvider.exe   ← The worker
    │   └── 📁 _internal/                      ← Worker's tools
    │
    └── 📁 WindowSupportGuardian/        ← Guardian's house
        ├── 📄 WindowSupportGuardian.exe      ← The guardian
        └── 📁 _internal/                      ← Guardian's tools

Guardian's Job:
"Is the Worker running? Let me check..."

BEFORE MY FIX:
  Guardian: "Let me look in WindowSupport for Worker.exe"
  Guardian: "Hmm, not here... ❌"

AFTER MY FIX:
  Guardian: "Let me check WindowSupport/WindowPowerShellProvider/ folder"
  Guardian: "Found it! Worker is running! ✅"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
====================

1. RUN THIS COMMAND:

   PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\rebuild_all.ps1

   This is like "repairing" both programs with the new directions.

2. WAIT FOR IT TO FINISH

   You'll see messages like:
   - "Building get_your_staff_id.exe..."
   - "Building WindowPowerShellProvider.exe..."
   - "Building WindowSupportGuardian.exe..."
   - "BUILD COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!"

3. TEST IT

   Go to: dist\WindowSupport\WindowPowerShellProvider\
   Double-click: WindowPowerShellProvider.exe
   
   It should start WITHOUT crashing! 🎉

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

IMPORTANT RULES:
================

✅ DO:
   - Keep the WindowPowerShellProvider FOLDER and its contents together
   - Keep the WindowSupportGuardian FOLDER and its contents together
   - Move them as FOLDERS, not individual files

❌ DON'T:
   - Try to take just the .exe file out of its folder
   - Delete the _internal folders
   - Separate the .exe from its _internal folder

Think of it like a laptop and its charger:
- The .exe is like the laptop
- The _internal folder is like the charger
- You need BOTH for it to work!

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SUMMARY IN PLAIN ENGLISH:
==========================

OLD SETUP:
- Programs were single files
- They crashed because they couldn't find their helper files
- Guardian couldn't find the Worker

NEW SETUP:
- Programs are now folders with all their files organized inside
- No more crashes! Everything is right where it needs to be
- Guardian knows exactly where to find the Worker

MY FIX:
- Updated Guardian's "address book" to find Worker in the new location
- Guardian now checks multiple places, smart enough to find Worker
  wherever you install it

YOUR ACTION:
- Just rebuild using the command above
- Test it
- Enjoy your working programs! 🎉

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

QUESTIONS?
==========

Q: Why are there so many files in _internal?
A: Those are like "ingredients" your program needs to work. Just like
   a car needs engine parts, your program needs these files.

Q: Can I delete the _internal folder?
A: NO! The .exe won't work without it. They're a team!

Q: Where should I keep these folders?
A: Anywhere you want! Just keep each folder complete. The Guardian
   will find the Worker automatically.

Q: Do I need to update anything in the future?
A: No, this fix is permanent. Once rebuilt, it just works!
